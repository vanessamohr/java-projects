# My Java Projects (beginner)

### Task management system for a hypothetical firm
For this project I had to implement OOP for the first time (except for some prior C++ experience). The classes in this project act as a hypothetical main menu interface for a construction firm. PoisedEngineering.java contains the main method where Person and Project objects can be instantiated. Person and Project are classes with attributes, a constructor, getters and setters and other methods. Project/person details can be updated, with text files acting as a hypothetical 'database'. The text files are updated when changes are made to objects using their setter functions, via the 'main menu' that calls the applicable methods. Data can also be extracted from these text files to work with in the development environment. 
### Update
A further development of this project included using SQL queries in Java to facilitate the use of a MySQL database. I have also since learned about documentation using JavaDoc, and included some elements. The "main menu interface" now allows a user to enter new information on people/projects and add it to the database, as well as extract any information already in the database. The main method is now just called Poised. The old class files for Person and Project are no longer included.
