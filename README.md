# My Java Projects (beginner)

### Task management system for a non-existent firm
For this project I had to implement OOP for the first time (except for some prior C++ experience). PoisedEngineering.java contains the main method where Person and Project objects can be instantiated. Person and Project are public classes, with attributes, a constructor, getters and setters and other methods.
